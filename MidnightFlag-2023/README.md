# Midnight Flag 2023 - Black Box
## About
The Midnight Flag is organized by the [ESNA](https://esna.bzh/) students in Bretagne, France.  
It's an intermediate-level CTF with a good OSINT category (another CTF, strictly OSINT this one is also organized and called Stranger Case, check it out!).

## Specs
2023 was the 3rd edition of the Midnight Flag, it was called Black Box.  
It has the distinctive characteristic of being a nightly CTF, it opens around 9PM on Saturday and ends at 8AM on Sunday.  
It's a team, remote, Jeopardy CTF and the flag format is `^MCTF{.+}$`, the main categories are Web, Crypto, Pwn, Reverse, Forensic and OSINT, it also has a Steganography category.

Also this year was special because this remote event was the qualifiers for another IRL CTF in Rennes, France (and we proudly qualified for it (: ).
