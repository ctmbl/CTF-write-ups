## About

UnitedCTF is a CTF organized by multiple student hacking clubs and organizations of Montréal, Québec, mainly JDIS, DCI and RHUM (from UdeS, ETS and UQAM).
It is designed to be a beginner-intermediate oriented CTF to introduce new comers of these clubs to the hacking and CTF world.

## Specs

2022 has been the 3rd edition of the CTF (you can find their archives [here](#links)).
It spread on 1 week from September 30th 2022 to October 7th. The long format is probably chosen to let to beginners the time to discover multiple domains and learn.
It's a Jeopardy CTF and the flag format is `^FLAG-.+$`, the challenges are mainly Web, Crypto and Pwn/Reverse oriented, a bit of Forensic but no OSINT and an original Dynamic Malware Analysis category.
