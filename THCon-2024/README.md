The [THCon](https://thcon.party/), which stands for Toulouse Hacking Convention, is organized by a team of professionals, students and researchers from all over France, in Toulouse, France.  
It's first of all a 2-day convention on Thursday and Friday, where you can follow a good number of rumps and keynotes from professionals and researchers. A CTF follows on Saturday.
